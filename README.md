# Web Coding Challenge

The [coding challenge](coding-challenge.md) is optional if you already have some code that you're proud of and can share with us.

Coding Challenge Requirements

[Requirements can be found here.](coding-challenge.md)

How we review
----------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least two of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to skip certain features aside provided you mention them out in your project's README. 

The aspects of your code we will review include:

* **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Version Control**: are you commiting early and often ? how good are your git commit messages ? 
* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
